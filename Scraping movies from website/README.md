Scrapes the top 100 movies of all time from a website. Generates a text file called `movies.txt` that lists the movie titles in ascending order (starting from 1).
The idea behind this project is to be able to use BeautifulSoup to obtain some data - like movie titles - from a website like Empire's.

Since websites change very frequently, the project uses a URL from the Internet Archive.

In this case, the .txt file already exists. If deleted, executing the code will generate a new file.

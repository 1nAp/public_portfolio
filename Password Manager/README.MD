This is a simple password manager project I made while working with Tkinter. The program stores passwords in a json file which is freely readable, so I wouldn't suggest using this for anything serious :)

The program generates a window in which you can enter a website you'd like to store a password for, an email or username for the website, as well as a password. 
  
It features a search button allowing you to search for saved websites (which shows you the email/username and password for said website), and a generate password button if you don't want to make your own password.

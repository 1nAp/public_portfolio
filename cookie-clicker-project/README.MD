A project that turns automates the classic cookie clicker game. I made it as simple as possible, so higher cookies per second is possible with better optimization.

The project uses Selenium to interact with the browser - Google Chrome in this case.

After 5 minutes of running, it prints the cookies per second statistic to the console.

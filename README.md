# public_portfolio
My public project portfolio.

In here you will find a variety of projects ranging in difficulty and type of project.

Some of them will work as-is, and others deal with sensitive data which I've hidden in environmental variables, making the code itself unusable. The code, can, however, be easily modified by incorporating your own valid environmental variables.

Python-based projects are written using Pycharm 3.11.

HTML-based projects are written using VS Code 1.99.0.
